        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>At Roots and Buds, our mission is to
             promote the benefits of plant life
              and inspire a love of gardening and 
              sustainable living. <br> 
              Our website was founded in 2023 by
               Simran Singh, who is passionate about 
               sharing her knowledge and experience
                with others. <br>
                Our team is made up of experienced gardeners, 
                horticulturists, and environmental advocates who 
                share a commitment to sustainability and environmental stewardship. <br> 
                We believe that planting and caring for plants can have a positive impact on our health, 
                communities, and the planet, and we strive to inspire others to incorporate more plant life into their daily lives. <br>
                 Our values are rooted in a deep appreciation for the diversity and beauty of plant life, as well as a commitment 
                 to reducing our environmental impact and promoting social and environmental justice. <br>
                We encourage our audience to get 
                involved in local gardening 
                initiatives, support environmental 
                causes, and engage with us on social 
                media.
